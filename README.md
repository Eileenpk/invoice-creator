# invoice-creator
This was a Scrimba solo project. The project requirements were;
- Have an array to hold services requested
- buttons to add service to array
- place to display data from array to be updated every time the array changes.
- Don't charge > once for the same service
- Total cost stays updated
- button to "send invoice" (reset)
- stretch: remove items after adding
